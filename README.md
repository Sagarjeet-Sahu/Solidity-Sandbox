# Solidity Sandbox

## Overview
This project aims to create a simplified in-browser Solidity sandbox to facilitate easier onboarding and experimentation for new developers.

## Features
- Project Structure Sidebar:
    - Ability to create new files (.sol) and folders within the project.
    - Simple drag-and-drop functionality for organizing files.
- Code Editor:
    - Syntax highlighting for Solidity.
    - Integration with a Solidity compiler (browser-based or via external API).
    - Basic error reporting for compilation issues.
- Output Panel:
    - Display compilation results (success, warnings, or errors).
- Stretch Goal:
    - Implement a simulated blockchain environment for testing contract deployment.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open index.html in your web browser.

## Evaluation Criteria
- Core Functionality: Ensure the sandbox allows for project creation, code editing, and compilation.
- Usability: Assess the intuitiveness of the interface, particularly for newcomers to Solidity.
- Extensibility: Consider if the design allows for potential future features, even if not fullyÂ implemented."# Solidity-Sandbox"
